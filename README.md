## Hardware
- Main system features:
  - Switching two independent loads
  - Measuring current through the loads
  - Measuring mains voltage
  - Displaying power consumption of the two loads on a display
  - (Optional) Logging power consumption data to the SD card (this will likely be replaced by a web interface)
